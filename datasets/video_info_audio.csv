going to go through Thailand Bali Singapore Malaysia Lao Cambodia and Vietnam I am not discussing a covid-19 requirements I'm only discussing this as a UK passport holder Citizen and obviously you should find up-to-date information into your own adequate research before any trip number one is Thailand the visa for Thailand is pretty simple at the moment if you want to spend less than 30 days in Thailand all you have to do is turn it up currently has a 30-day free visa on arrival the only thing to think about with getting this freezer upon arrival is that they might ask you for proof of travel basically all this means is that the time immigration want to see that you're actually planning on leaving before the 30 days runs out obviously if you booked a return flight from Thailand or if you've already booked your mama travel there is no problem here you can just prove to immigration if they do ask you that you have it alreadyis it a lot of Backpackers myself included prefer to keep their options open and you might not have booked anything already if that is the case don't worry I got a link in my bio on with ticket.com which is what we used to show proof now it's not to say that you will get asked for this it is completely randomized who they do and don't ask so it's up to you if you have this already prepared just in case you do so that's what you need to do if you want to spend less than 30 days what do you do if you want to spend longer than 30 days since Thailand got a couple of options you can make the most out of the fact that you will continue to get free 30 days every single time you enter so you could do something like a Visa and basically we did this and that we spent 30 days in Thailand we fancied going to Bali so we then went over to Bali for a little while and when we returned back in Thailand we were able to renew our city days and get another 30 days free upon re-entry that is a great way of trying to work it into your itinerary so maybe starting and finishing entire land to give yourself and accumulated 60 days over to 30 days periodwhy isn't for you or if you'd like to spend the 60 days all together in one hit without having to leave silence at home you can still do it but you've got two options to do this as well no option number one is you could do an easy before you arrive in Thailand this is something that really did and I've got a full video about it but as you'll see from this video we left it so last minute that it didn't arrive in time for our trip and unfortunately we couldn't even use it so make sure that you leave yourself plenty of time to do this before you go to Thailand because we didn't get the visa accepted in time we just turned up on the 30 day free visa and we decided to then extend our Visa by going to an immigration office all you have to do is turn it up to an immigration office you need to pay in cash and then you'll get the visa hopefully accepted there in that will give you a maximum of six days that you can spend time in Thailand instead so obviously option number one is two of them that evening before you arrive in Thailand or option number two is just turn up the title and extend it once you get there after doing both optionsplaylist including a checklist of everything you need to bring with you to the immigration office so Thailand is finished 30 days free you can send to 60 days by doing that or extend your Visa in an immigration office simple now let's move on to Bali now we visited Bali in November 2022 the remember that this could be a little bit outdated and you should always check the up-to-date information for this so badly is pretty simple because it is a visa on arrival and it is a 30 day these upon arrival it's different to Highland because it is not free you don't have to pay for it but you can just pay for this as you go through theupon arrival don't need to pay in cash you can pay for the barley visa on arrival on card again I've got a full video all about this in my Bali playlist if you'd like to spend longer than 30 days in Bali you can extend this by going to an immigration office at the time that we went to go to an immigration office on three separate occasions and I'm not going to lie it was a pain in the backside application process to do I have got a full video all about this but I believe that this has now slightly changed and you can now apply for a Visa extension in Bali online instead country number three is Singapore and we visited Singapore in December 2022 all we have to do to get into Singapore was doing a declaration form for 48 hours before we didn't have to pay for all sort out any Visa we had free entry intowe just have to declare our movements in Singapore 48 hours before and you can find that on the UK government website so that's pretty simple next is Malaysia again we visited Malaysia in December 2022 and we didn't spend too long here Malaysia is also pretty simple you can get a 90-day free visa on arrival so you can just rock up to Malaysia and enjoy it up to 90 days for free next is loud we entered Loud by land border because we were doing the slow boat from immigration the last season is a 30-day visa on arrival it is not a freebies you will need to pay and you will need to pay in cash so if you're passing through a longboard you need to make sure that you have some form of cash with you Costas approximately 37 lbs but we paid in bath you can play that US dollarselevation cap or from the currency of the country you are currently acting so we were leaving Thailand and we were able to pay in Thai baht if you are entering from Cambodia you'd be able to pay in real and if you're entering from Vietnam you'd be able to pay in Vietnamese Dong currency exchange in the cost of the Visa varies depending on what currency you would like to pay in the cheapest option is to pay in US dollars but there was a couple of reasons why we avoided doing this the reason we avoided paying in US Dollars was because they are so particular about the quality of the US dollars that you are providing that they will often turn them away you need to meticulously check that there is no rips marks mud smudges or anything at all on the dollars as they will not accept them the other thing that you will need for the visa on arrival in loud is a passport image we were told to be a specific size but in all honesty our group submitted it in many different sizes really didn't matter just make sure that you have some form of a passport image that you can attach to theif you're interested in getting more information about the visa on arrival for now I have got a full video in my slow boat video which can be found in my loud playlist next is Cambodia we had a little bit of a problem getting into Cambodia but that was nothing other than our own fault Cambodia is very very similar to allow it is a 30-day visa on arrival that you need to pay for in cash once again we passed into Cambodia via a land border from Southern Lowry apologies for pronouncing that wrong and the only problem with that was that we didn't have any cash the Cambodian States upon arrival at the equivalent of 308 US Dollars you can pay in any of the local currencies so US Dollars Cambodian Riel Malaysian kids over Vietnamese song he had been told that there was an ATM on the border and fortunately there wasn't I have got a full video about that once again in my Cambodia Tick Tock playlist the other option for Cambodia if you don't want to domovies are put arrival is Stephen e Visa it's exactly the same as the visa on arrival 30 days but if you'd like to be organized you can get that accepted beforehand if you have plenty of time to complete the EVS at that's fine you can just place that online it can take about a week but remember if you don't even have time and it doesn't get accepted you will not be able to answer on the Visa and you'll have to pay twice as you have to enter on the visa on arrival instead and then lastly let's talk Vietnam at the moment if you want to spend 15 days or less in Vietnam there is a free visa on arrival up to 15 days so again similar to Thailand there is nothing that you really need to do you can just Waltz into Vietnam and spend up to 15 days that we entered Vietnam by London from Cambodia and we entered via mock by immigration port in my opinion 15 days is not enough to see it now so we chose to spend 30 days in order to spend 30 days inbefore arrival the Eevee's a process costs $25 and you obviously pay online you need to have it accepted before you enter Vietnam so you need to leave plenty of time to get the process accepted I got a full video about process and all of the tips and tricks for completing it in my Vietnam playlist or just that it is it will cost you $25 I need to take some form of like a professional selfie in order to upload a picture of yourself you need to know which Port you're planning on entering by so whether that's a longboard or an airport so that you can show exactly what you're entering by you need to know what day you plan on entering Vietnam and there is a little bit wiggle room about this but I wouldn't recommend it and I would definitely recommend entering on the day that you have specified and lastly our personal six days so I recommend leaving over a week in order to get that process finished unfortunately at the moment there isn't anything you can do to extend a 30-dayplay Vietnam Visa you're the only option at the moment is to do a Visa and basically means is you need to leave Vietnam in order to reapply for another visa and re-enter Vietnam on a 30-day Visa again it's not something we've done personally so unfortunately I can't give much more information on that but in conclusion Thailand Indonesia Singapore Malaysia and Cambodia can all be done on arrival in Vietnam is the only one that you need to be thinking about at least a week before your trip so I hope this helps you plan your trip and remember I do have Services where I can go through Christmas with you through one to one call if you're interested in that link in my bio and like and follow them all
